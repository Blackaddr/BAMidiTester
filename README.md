# BAMidiTester
A basic MIDI CC controller and tester based on JUCE.

This program is a modified version of JUCE miditest example. I have added an area that functions as a graphical MIDI controller, mean to roughly resemble a guitar pedal.

I use it for computer MIDI control of my MIDI controlled audio hardware while developing audio effects.
